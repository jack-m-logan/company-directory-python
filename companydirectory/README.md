# Company Directory

The second of two final projects completed during my coding traineeship. 

## Project Description

For this project, I was given a loose specification, to "create a desktop website that can also run on a mobile that allows for the maintenance ofa company personnel database to see who’s who, which department they are in and where they are”.

I responded to the project with a User Requirements Specification document, outlining my approach to the task. I included diagrams, flow charts and a wireframe of the UI. The URS was signed off and I implemented the system I had designed.  

After finishing development, I performed a round of user testing where participants were asked to interact with the system in various ways, including stress testing. This led to some further improvements before further testing and final submission. 

## Technologies 

- HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript (jQuery)
- PHP (reading JSON data)
- MariaDB (CRUD operations)

## Installation 

The project is running live at jackmlogan.com/site/companydirectory, or the project can be forked and run/developed through a local server (e.g. XAMPP).

## Licence

The specification was provided by IT Career Switch and as such should not be used commercially.
